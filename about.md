I'm a Computer Engineering Sophomore from the North of India, Jammu and Kashmir. I'm deeply interested in computer engineering and here I write about some tech stuff, some programming stuff and some experimental stuff I do with my laptop.

I spend most of my time experimenting with code be it `JavaScript`, `C/C++` or `Java`.
I also follow Facebook's Engineering blog where I read about their engineering ethics, how they go about solving issues in their products and also the new tools/APIs they develop for the world to use. Even though sometimes I really have no idea what they are writing about but still I keep on following it as it never dissapoints me in making me realise how great experimenting with code can be.

Apart from all the geekiness, i'm also a food lover and I do follow cricket ;).
