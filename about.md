I'm a Computer Engineering Sophomore from the North of India, Jammu and Kashmir. I'm deeply interested in computer engineering and here I write about some tech stuff, some programming stuff and some experimental stuff I do with my laptop.

Most of my time is spend on Facebook's Engineering blog where I read about their engineering ethics, how they go about solving issues in their products and also the new tools/APIs they develop for the world to use.
