Programming is an art and a programmer is an artist. An artist needs some motivation to bring his art to life and same is the case with a programmer. Motivation is really essential for a programmer or else programming just becomes a dull, boring and a mundane task.
As a programmer myself I face that quite a lot and once I lose my motivation then it becomes very hard to spend even a couple of minutes in front of the laptop. Since programmers don't give up, I decided to get rid of this problem because once i'm demotivated I spend a lot of time doing unessential stuff. So in a state of demotivation instead of browsing through facebook profiles I started to spend my time reading engineering blogs of [Facebook][fb] as well as [Twitter][tweet]. That worked really well for me to get motivated once again.


These blogs are really really good for a programmer to get an insight of the stuff which happens at [Facebook][fb] and [Twitter][tweet]. Every programmer I think should check out these blogs once in a while if in a state of demotivation. Facebook also has a separate engineering blog where it writes about all of its engineering stuff, the technologies its using as well as creating for the world to use.
Between the two social networking giants Facebook is my personal favourite. I'm a regular follower of their work and it helps me stay motivated so that I can be as good as the people writing that blog.


I have been in a state of demotivation for a long time now but this time its not the social networking blog which helped me get out of it, this time my very own blog did the trick for me.
Creating this website and making it look the way I wanted it to was like an achievement for me and that motivated me to continue coding again.


Another thing which I have observed with many progrmammers is that they just go after the problem they face while coding something and they don't stop until they achive the functionality they want. This acts as a kind of motivation for them. 


So all in all if you want to succeed as a programmer, you gotta stay motivated !!
