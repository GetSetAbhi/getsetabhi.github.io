Project Flash has officially begun. As Mark Zuckerberg declared this year as the year of invention, I decided to build something on my own.
It's about creating a news application that basically fetches news headlines from trusted news sources and serves them to the user and user doesn't have to go out browsing for them.
First challenge is the layout. Over the past few days I have experimented with a lot of UI designs but I am not able to stick to a single one.
Secondly I am trying to find out the right technologies/libraries that will power the whole app. My search for appropriate technologies/libraries took me to Facebook's Engineering [blog][fb], Square's Open Source [website][square]. Today's day was spent by experimenting with a lot of stuff and I think the experiments will go on for a while until I develop them such that they can be used for implementation in "Project Flash".
Lastly, I think this blog will require a lot of makeover.
