Today's day was spent by again testing a new layout. Layout is of utmost importance so everyday a new layout is being tested. Since I have little experience in UI/UX so I thought it'll be a good idea to try and implement a UI/UX design which is already being used by all of people worldwide. Layout is still subject to change as long as satisfaction is not there.

Secondly, some image libraries were tried. So now decision has to be taken between [Fresco][fresco] by Facebook and [Picasso][picasso] by Square.
I am yet to learn Image caching and android networking for which again there's confused between [OkHttp][Ok] by Square and [Volley][volley].

There's so much to be done and so less time to do it :(

[picasso]: http://square.github.io/picasso/
[fresco]: http://frescolib.org
[Ok]: http://square.github.io/okhttp/
[volley]: http://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html
