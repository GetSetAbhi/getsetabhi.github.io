Today I was guilty of doing nothing. I did absolutely nothing today. I had a plan to try and learn about [OkHttp][ok] so that I could use it for the Project but I didn't.

However, I came across a [blog][redfin] by Redfin explaining how they were able to improve the performance and memory usage of displaying images on their android app using 
[Fresco][fresco] image libary. Here I just learned how to loading images for views currently on screen while using recyclerview. This was extremely useful as it will help in preserving memory which is of value in coding.

So now I'm going try and make up for the time that I wasted the whole day by learning about Okhttp.
