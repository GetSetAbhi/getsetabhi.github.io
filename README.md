======================

Personal blogging space of mine in this Wide World of Web powered by [Jekyll][jk] and hosted on [Github][gh].

## Why `Jekyll` ?

- I don't have to worry about FTP or SMTP.
- No database to Create, Update or Delete.
- No need to manage a CMS based system.
- I don't have to worry about server management.
- All I need is a text editor to write a post and a terminal to push it up on git. It's just easy Blogging.
